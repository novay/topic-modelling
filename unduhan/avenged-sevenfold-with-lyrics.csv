Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets, now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore

Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night (night)
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to take all your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The King...

Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid

Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (light)
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

There's a taste of fear (hail, hail, hail)
When the henchmen call (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to tame the land (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to claim it all

Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king, hail to the one

Hail to the king!

They all know
They all know

Sorry did I wake your dreams?
Some questions run too deep
We only only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

Aaaah

Help me find my way
I said help me find my way
No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I wanna be

You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind, but some day you will find
That sanity's left us all blind, and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die, I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind, then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind, and walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

People think I'm insane, because I am frowning all the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh, and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late"

One group's taught how and the other group is taught why

There's no need to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see

No reason to tell you what's in mind

No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see!

Look what's happening now
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated
Different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?

Extra ordinary
These hand-me-downs worn in so nice

As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may

But years leave with nothing to find

Roll call, study, license, freedom

Party, fighting, wasted, summer
Questions, doubtful, wedding, family
Happy, ever, after, dead end

The bestest part of waking up
Mundane ideation
This dark roast got me (So fucked up)

As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days, they come and days, they go
Until no more days set you free

Well on my way, my way to lose me
It strikes me that I don't belong here anymore
As I observe my own reflection, try a happy face
Staring through the warm tears, a sad frown from the cold years
Adieu, I never had the will anyway

Toss a rope over the branch and fall into the night
And here I swing, from my family tree
Say goodnight

Life is but a dream anyway"

I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all

To daddy's little girl to read the writings on the wall
While cast into the nothingness, the final curtain call

Left to rot in your darkest hour
Prayers won't help you now

Place and time always on my mind

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold

A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find
A place in my mind

9;An Epic Of Time Wasted;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet;"In my dreams
I awake as daylight breaks and wash my face
Put my bedroom back in its place and tucked away
Write a note of a few things I want to say
And leave it on the fireplace
And in my dreams, another day

In my dreams
I stare out in the distance of the city scene
From way up here, it's so serene
There's nothing said
As I make myself more comfortable with the edge
I leap into the darkest night
Wind on my face, it satisfies
I never have felt so alive
And in my dreams, I fly away"
10;And All Things Will End;Waking The Fallen;"[M. Shadows:]
Our truth is painted across the sky
In our reflection, we learn to fly
No hand to hold us
No one to save us from tomorrow

Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?

Think for a moment of all the lives
Stripped of their essence before their time
We stand to conquer
But is there nothing left tomorrow?

I'm sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
There's no light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?

[Neil deGrasse Tyson:]
We have one collective hope: The Earth
And yet uncounted people remain hopeless
Famine and calamity abound
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war
People kill and get killed in the name of someone else's concept of God
Dare we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?
Each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane
Every fictionalized dictator, biased partisan and wayward son
Are part of the curtains of society's racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts
And you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers
When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets
Each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity
I see beyond the plight of humans. I see a universe ever-expanding
With its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time
However big our world is — in our hearts, our minds, in our out-sized atlases?
The universe is even bigger
There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world's beaches
More stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed
More stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuance of our species
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations
Would be prone to act on their low contracted prejudices
And would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment —
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective
A perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above, nor below, but within"

It holds in place my plastic bones
Cast button eyes reflect an image

Cue the breeze
That sway the painted trees
Toy yellow birds upon the rooftops sing
In chorus with the buzzing bees
Melt in Sun L.E.D. beams
From the sky being held on a string
While boredom tears me apart at the seams

Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves
In
Hell

Ears made of wax unfit to hear
Day after day, it all plays over
Dedicated loop
Same year after year

R.S.V.P. if we can count you in
Empty as we play pretend
Send our thoughts with you and to your kin
And in case I don't see you again
Good afternoon, good evening, and good night

Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves
In
Hell

Living feign in porcelain
And just smart enough to know nothing at all
Pull my string and make me cry
Advertisement, moral scrawl
A semblance of choice when there's no choice at all
Out of stock, 'the end is nigh'

Burn
Body burn
Burn

Looking at the fields so green

I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made
Will leave you empty

Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

Grant them eternal rest, oh Lord
Embrace them into your army of undead
Strike with vengeance those who oppose your will
And lay waste to all those who shall be sent before you
Walk with them and shield them from the blinding light of servitude
And devastate your enemies as they die by your hand.
Amen

[Latin:]
Prodigia comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium.

Rise from ashes
Violent clashes
My soul, vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin

I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames"

I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground

As tears go by

Doin' things I used to do
They think are new

Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

[M. Shadows & The Rev:]
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in her
It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

[M. Shadows & The Rev:]
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do? Not long enough)
To make it up to you

I'll do whatever you want me to do

For the rest of your unnatural life?

Float like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
""Someone dissolution""
This is ""I am all"" as ""I am none""
Here we fly so high, no, I, no coming down

Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

(I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything)
I walk with death in final exhalation
And come apart through violent separation
A thousand floors ascend into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head)
And down below I leave a stranger laying lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
I ascend and leave behind the ""used to be""
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes and see
I see
I see

Nobody

Breathe in the silence, ebb and flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum in light come dark in equal phase
All I ever was, has been and always will be

Here I end as I started again beyond death and borne on the wind
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

A crack in the darkness
A tear in the sky
A narrow moment when we find ourselves
And all we occupy
Return to the boundless
Immerse in the free
Letting go as you lose your name
And all you've known to be

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody"
25;Coming Home;Hail To The King;"There's a calmness to the air outside
Watch the sun color the sight of a morning sky
But all I see are clouds of darkest gray
A full eclipse to veil the start of another day

Hear the laughter as the children smile
Hold a newborn close and dream for a little while
But all I hear is death knock at my door
And think of painful journeys our young must endure

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Touch the water with your own two hands
Let the freedom bell bring calm to a troubled land
But all I feel are my two feet in chains
I know the system, but I can't figure out the game

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Take it all away from me
Take it all away...

There's more than meets the eye 'round here, look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne, but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Lookin' back on her to see there's nothing around

I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings

So lost 'til I stumbled upon
Two roads in front of me, I had to take my time
To the right I could see a church
I took a step in that direction first
But to the left there was a watering hole
Where they were whiskey drunk
And now that's where I wanna pray

The fight down here goes on and on

If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see

There's gotta be another way to go
A way that's much more feasible
A combination of both these lives
A central path without choosing a side
I make decisions one at a time
And no I never say I'm always right
I'm confident that when I stand on my own
You'll see the truest form of a man when I'm shining through

The fight down here goes on and on

Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see

Oh, I hear them now
All the religious rhyme

You're a sin, you're a sin, you're a sinner

The left isn't better
It's just more of the same
Condemning all these people for what they believe
I'll climb to the top of their mountain again

No harness up to save me this way
And the closer to the top I get
The more they take aim
But I'm not you

I may not be perfect but I've always been true
I may not be worthy in your eyes
Climb up from the bottom for the last time
The last one, the last one, the last time

If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse if they slaughtered innocent beings?

As the visible scars, they multiply
Kiss it goodbye
Too stubborn and I'll destroy

Been pressurized
Nowhere to hide
Swallowing light

While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

You crowd me with all that you stole
Oh, how the mighty fall

No thought of me, no thought of me

A-where she will stay-ay

60;Lost;Avenged Sevenfold;"[M. Shadows:]
A living nightmare
Asleep but still aware
The endless torture
The painless pleasure

I grasp myself
Trying to regain control
I experience and learn
In another faction of my mind
So confused
But everything makes perfect sense
Can't feel the pain
Emotional pain's so much deadlier
Lost, you've just been raped (Pain!)
Your friends can't help you
Why won't they help you?
Another reality

This can't be happening
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

[M. Shadows & Valary DiBenedetto:]
Trying hard to figure out what's done
I scramble but now I run
The images in my head
All the problems that I've been fed
All the problems that I've been fed
The problems in my head

Punching slowly, my mind can't change the speed
As my victims bleed
No matter what I do or how hard I try
Can't use my abilities, use my ability

Art of illusion

[M. Shadows:]
My razor sharp knife's edge (my razor sharp knife's edge)
Pierces my victim's body (pierces my victim's body)
But I (but I)
Cannot take their soul (cannot take their soul)

62;M.I.A.;City Of Evil;"I've been away,
Searching for a reason,
Another purpose to find.
I've sailed the seas,
Fought my many demons,
I've looked to gods in the skies.

I've stood in hell,
Where many had to suffer,
I stared the devil in the eyes.
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols,
And found the great gates of fire.

Had many storms question my conviction,
Gave armies reason to rise.
The hangman's searching for bones he can borrow,
While I escaped in the night,
Fight or flight.

[Chorus:]
Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

Escaped the hail of calculated mortars,
Then drank the blood of a king.
The desert rain has washed away direction,
Had angels looking after me,
So it seems.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

[Guitar solo]

My story ends not far from where it started,
My weary limbs have grown old.
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad,
Home is where the heart is I've been told,
So I go.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
On and on it goes
Vacant hope to take

Hey – I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade
On and on it goes
Wash my view away

Hey – I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave, trapped in the dark
Slam all the locks, death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fucking
Hands off me
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with
Hands of fate
Shame to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die, buried alive
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Die, buried alive (let me take in your soul)

And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Nightfall haunts us all from the shadows
Cynical beauty now lights the halls
Before the flicker there was only blackness
The end is coming and all my friends are dead

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head

(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)

The Labyrinth hedges return to soil
Mother's weeping will go unheard
The dove that once flew here through the mazes
Had seen the darkness and chose to take its life

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head"

Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
""I'll be here waiting."" tested and secure

When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

""I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me.""

Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze 'til I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near

I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sights - venomous control
You won't make it right - my appetite has grown
Lost the final fight - no love will be shown

Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sights - venomous control
You can't make it right - my appetite has grown
Lost the final fight - no love will be shown"
101;Tonight The World Dies;Nightmare;"Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat, there's no one to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away
Away, what
I came here for something and I'm not turning back
Strong piece of mind but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience but it means the world to me

You hold the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death

I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart, handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, right now
Now you turn the other way

You've turned away from me
The future's much too far away to see
I hope you learn the truth
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you"
102;Trashed And Scattered;City Of Evil;"Yeah, you've been alone
I've been gone for far too long
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

Never let it show
The pain I've grown to know
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

Letters keep me warm
Helped me through the storm
But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died
My prayers have made it through yeah
'Cause with all these things we do
It don't matter when I'm coming home to you

I've always been true
I've waited so long just to come hold you
I'm making it through
It's been far too long, we've proven our
Love over time's so strong, in all that we do
The stars in the night, they lend me their light
To bring me closer to heaven with you

(Bring me closer)

But with all that we've been through
After all this time I'm coming home to you

I reach towards the sky I've said my goodbyes
My heart's always with you now
I won't question why so many have died

After all this time I'm coming home to you"
103;Turn The Other Way;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet;"Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, 
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. 
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight"
104;Unbound (The Wild Ride);Avenged Sevenfold;"We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die

Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls
I'd make a decision if granted the privilege but I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize

You own the burg. We sleep in streets
You dine then waste. We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?

Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced
How can we see outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion

(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)

Dear radiation, my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion

It's an illusion"
105;Unholy Confessions;Waking The Fallen;"Lights paint the windows in the sky
The past is sown
In pursuit our spirit shown
But for now there's no one home

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

My sweet Medusa, reflect the empty in our being
Snakes born of fire conjure the demons in our dreams

In void we illustrate our lives
Emerge in small
Heed the sign meant to evolve
To the end we send the call

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

Where children shiver in the cold
The sun will shine
Just a touch to heal the blind
In ourselves we hope to find

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

Alone"
106;Until The End;Diamonds In The Rough;"The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spill the lies
We'd see the world through devil's eyes

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one-way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter gotta fix what don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

That's just the price to play
So tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight, right

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
Time"
107;Victim;Nightmare;"As the embers rose through the Roman Sky
Tell me, were you calm when they took your life?

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice, words forever shine, yeah

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied
""As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine, yeah""

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true"
108;Waking The Fallen;Waking The Fallen;"So much time I've wasted
That I truly never thought it would really come to this
Never would I doubt you
But the truth kept smacking me in the face

Reality
You never stopped to think
And you ripped us apart
How could you?
Now our time is gone
But now it's breaking my heart

Tears run down as I think of the days we've had
And the memories will last forever
But you and I will die
And go our separate ways

You are the one
You are the wrong one
Breaking the mold
Going your own way, go

All I
Feel is
Betrayal
Betrayal

So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this

We had something great
Then it was washed away
We had something more
Than I can explain
I'm sorry

(No) We had something great
Then it was washed away
(No) Not all friendships last
The genuine are harder to take
(No) Time to start again
I hope someday you'll think of me
(No) The end reality
I know someday I'll think of you"
109;Waking The Fallen: Resurrected;Waking The Fallen;"Godless - meteoric war,
Anger – our existence nevermore.
You awoke the giants who were dormant in the sky,
Comets raining death from a fiery eye.

[Chorus:]
Mother of all, your time is coming,
One with eternity.
When planets collide,
Planets collide.

Damage – galaxy destruct,
Endless - celestial orbit corrupt.
You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

[Chorus]

Take heed, the violent march is closing in,
You can't defeat them on your own.
Weapons are loaded for the final stand,
And they're all aimed at you from heaven!

Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.

You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

110;Walk;Diamonds In The Rough;"Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

Nightmare – full of pain
Nightmare – full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll

Take away
Take away
Take away
Take away

You can't be replaced
I'm left alone with you
In spirit and the words
You wrote to me

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow"
111;Warmness On The Soul;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet;"We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing
We all know what to do but no one does it
Now this time has passed and full of regret

Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone
When they get back, it won't be the same

(Never be the same)

My life, you've always been there
Now you're gone, and my head's spinning
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past
Moving on your time has run out

Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past
So rarely I get to see your face
Growing I looked to you in guidance
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me

To me you were my life
To me you were my soul companion
Now you are so far away
Nothing can take away the times and the memories we had

Come back – to the days when we were young
Come back – to the days when nothing mattered
To the days when nothing mattered

And I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night"
112;We Come Out At Night;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet;"I sit stoic
Touch of the divine upon my neck
Lay me gently
Take my body down, let me ascend

Help me to hear and hear me to save
And save me before I've gone too far
Let me inhale my passage to hell
While slowly exhaling the scar

You walk on water
But the water swallows you

I lay quiet
Floating in the stillness of this tomb
Headstone empty
Choking on the flowers as they bloom

No one to know and no where to hide
And nothing of me I've left behind
Silence of one the meaning of none
And letting it all go to be

You walk on water
But the water swallows you
You're like no other
You're the other one in view

Don't let it be
Don't let it be
Don't let it

It's a beautiful morning
It's a beautiful day
Everybody is smiling
In a beautiful way

I took a walk to paint the flowers and the trees
The sun reflected gazing fondly on me
I made a picture and I put it in the rays outside
It washed the paint away and carried me home
I have finally arrived

There's no one but you... two

Dressed in armor
Just the hollow shell I was before

Help me to turn my attention on me
So empty just as I was before
Let me exhale concession to hell
While slowly embracing the scar

You walk on water
But the water swallows you
And you're like no other
You're the other one in view
Don't let it be
You walk on water
Don't let it be, don't let it be
But the water swallows you
Don't let it be
Don't let it, don't let it
And you're like no other
Don't let it be, don't let it be
You're the other one in view
Don't let it be"
113;We Love You;Life Is But A Dream…;"I feel insane
Every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance? 
By the look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not... not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin but deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not... not insane

(Mother)

Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall)
Come back again it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong now let me make it right

115;Wish You Were Here;The Stage;"Standing in the shade of altruism, answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Something far beyond a work of fiction, positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain

Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find

Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing, indeed

Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find

Sometimes when I look up to the sky I have to wonder are we
""Summoning the demon"" you and I?

Have you noticed that I'm needing it more now, more than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a steppingstone, oh

Like a blow to the ego the bitter pills are harder to take
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating God, in search of the divine
We're creating God. Committing suicide"
