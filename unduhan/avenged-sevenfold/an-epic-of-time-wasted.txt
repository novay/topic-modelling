So much time I've wasted
That I truly never thought it would really come to this
Never would I doubt you
But the truth kept smacking me in the face

Reality
You never stopped to think
And you ripped us apart
How could you?
Now our time is gone
But now it's breaking my heart

Tears run down as I think of the days we've had
And the memories will last forever
But you and I will die
And go our separate ways

You are the one
You are the wrong one
Breaking the mold
Going your own way, go

All I
Feel is
Betrayal
Betrayal

So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this

We had something great
Then it was washed away
We had something more
Than I can explain
I'm sorry

(No) We had something great
Then it was washed away
(No) Not all friendships last
The genuine are harder to take
(No) Time to start again
I hope someday you'll think of me
(No) The end reality
I know someday I'll think of you
