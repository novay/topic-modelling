When you see them coming in form (coming in form)
And they say they do what's best for you (what's best for you)
Fighting for one total control (total control)
They are planned and organized for you (for you)

Breaking their hold
Breaking their hold of control they strive
To keep you down, behind your back, the time has come, the end is near
It's when you sleep, so late at night, and in the light, getting prepared
It's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you won't exist
They are the few, with all the power
Our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out
Screaming, pulling on our pride
Stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise
