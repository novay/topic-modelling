I've been away,
Searching for a reason,
Another purpose to find.
I've sailed the seas,
Fought my many demons,
I've looked to gods in the skies.

I've stood in hell,
Where many had to suffer,
I stared the devil in the eyes.
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols,
And found the great gates of fire.

Had many storms question my conviction,
Gave armies reason to rise.
The hangman's searching for bones he can borrow,
While I escaped in the night,
Fight or flight.

[Chorus:]
Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

Escaped the hail of calculated mortars,
Then drank the blood of a king.
The desert rain has washed away direction,
Had angels looking after me,
So it seems.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

[Guitar solo]

My story ends not far from where it started,
My weary limbs have grown old.
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad,
Home is where the heart is I've been told,
So I go.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
[Guitar fades out]
