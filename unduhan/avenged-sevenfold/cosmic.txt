Fade
From all that was before
We shut another door
But not a last goodbye

Fate
Has taken once again
A fight we'll never win
And time again we try
Left alone, I can't wait too long
Fade

Love
We loved so many times
And in so many lives
Sometimes we got it right

Pain
It found its way back in
Until we meet again
Into that good night

None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever
I'll follow you

Dancing in the wind as roses born again
There you'll find me
Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand
There you'll find me
Writing in the caves as fire lights the way
There you'll find me
Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes
There you'll find me

Let it go
Yeah
Rings of dust and ice weightless in the night
There you'll find me
Let it go

Dancing in the wind as roses born again
There you'll find me
Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand
There you'll find me
Writing in the caves as fire lights the way
There you'll find me
Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes
There you'll find me

From all that was before
We shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Taken once again
A fight we'll never win
And time again we try
I'm gone
We loved so many times
And in so many lives
I'm gone
Sometimes we got it right
I'm gone
It found it's way back in
Until we meet again
I'm gone
Into that good
