Darkness coats us
The smell of fall
Changing season
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path
The chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead
Imprisoned souls
Trapped for eternity

Black crows break the silence
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can't stop it
Just enjoy it
Open up your mind and you will feel it too
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to
You can feel the thoughts of the dead
Feeling the thoughts of the dead
True or false, it's still there, breaking me
True or false, taking me, breaking me

You can feel it tonight
The wood has rotted away
Take the time absorb it
Their time is slipping away
Statues carved by hand
Statues that resemble their faces
They still breathe
Come join us

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away
