The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spill the lies
We'd see the world through devil's eyes

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one-way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter gotta fix what don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

That's just the price to play
So tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight, right

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
Time
