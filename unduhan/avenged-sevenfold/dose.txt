What's the matter dear
Seems the ghost
Is in your stall
For a thousand years
Taured lived within us all
I've come from
Somewhere beyond

Lost in a world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

Here in '54
Tastes of napalm fill the sky
Axis wins the war
Seems the crop of our divide
I've slipped through
Bodies aligned

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

All that's me
And all that's you
All that's false
And all that's true
On the sea you sailed away
Another time
You'd surely stay
It's only fabric so it seems
Our intimate reality
We're living simultaneously
While parallel in possibilities

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine
