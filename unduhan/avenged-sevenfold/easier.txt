It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way

I've been shaped by peaks and valleys
Found a plateau where I cursed at the sky
Sometimes I feel that the rain falls for me
Bound to the flesh till the day that I die

It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way

Days like this come as days go
And all that you love just as soon be goodbyes
What was so far for so long now behind me
What
Far
Long
So hold applause till the end of the ride

It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way
It's easier to just walk away
I know you'll see brighter days along the way

It's easier, it's easier
Easier
Easier, easier
It's easier
