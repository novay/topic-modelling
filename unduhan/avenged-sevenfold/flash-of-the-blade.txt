As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David
And you always killed the beast

Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins
And the bodies at your feet

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

The smell of resigned leather
The sticky iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parry
At the fencing master's call

He taught you all he knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance
On the screams of evil men

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)
