Forgotten faces
Lost in yesterdays realm
Drained with confusion
Where did it all go?
Look into the past, look into their faces
Never, the thought of being time fucked
But now they're all gone and all that's left is this blank faced picture
Ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished
Coasting through life didn't seize the day
No one ever realized that they're already dead
By the time you realize, you'll be dead too
Without another chance to save the world
These things they're gone, you're gone, forgotten
Now your face in my picture frame. It's gone forever
Right before my very eyes
And just when I thought I made light of things
It slips away into darkness
My life passes now I see
Just what this world does hold for me
It's getting hard, harder to breathe
Am I out of time is that what this means?
Well that's what it means
That's what it means, you and me try to breathe
Now you realize
Your life flies by
Now I realize
My life, I die
