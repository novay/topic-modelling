I am the man
Six days of bullshit, a wave of my hand
And you know what I need
Put your hands together, get down on your knees
Or climb a hill and just don't talk
I never made a man didn't trip when they walk the walk

It's so chic and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace

Can't tell me that all I see
Ain't a gift from the fabulous one
Thought about a name that came to me
Can you explain why the phone would ring?
Prayed so hard and oh my Lord
I got a spot at the front of the lot
Can't be late for my weekly date
'Cause we're gonna save someone

What? What have I done?
Jesus Christ
You gotta be kidding me

I am the plan
Cheap imitations by obsessive fans
But you're great, and fun to watch
On the seventh day I thought about world peace
But I decided just to take it off

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

It's so chic and we love
What you've done with the place
Compliments you with style and grace

Can't tell me that all I see
Ain't a gift from the fabulous one
Thought about a name that came to me
Explain why the phone would ring
Prayed so hard and oh my Lord
I got a spot at the front of the lot
Can't be late for my weekly date
'Cause we're gonna save someone

Ahh fuck, give me a delete button
Delete! Not too bad for a first try
