As they search for blood,
All eyes descend on one.
Honest man in chains,
But that don't matter anyway.

My judgement day.

My flesh will feed the demon,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find heretic blood.

Impose your will on me,
'Til fire sets me free.
The flames of hell burn bright.
My fate decided by their lies.

Final demise.

My flesh will feed the demon,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find heretic—heretic blood.

Please, don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me like this.
I've walked a fragile line and I've fallen down.
Please, don't leave me.

My flesh will feed the demon now,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find heretic—heretic blood.
