Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

Nightmare – full of pain
Nightmare – full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll

Take away
Take away
Take away
Take away

You can't be replaced
I'm left alone with you
In spirit and the words
You wrote to me

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
