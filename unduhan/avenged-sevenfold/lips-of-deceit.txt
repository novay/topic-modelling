The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste, losing control
I bleed in pain testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit, pull me from here

No one's innocent, so why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me
Up on me
Guilt, tearing me up inside
The innocent, an evil in disguise
The face of beauty to fall for
I fall to my knees, deceitful
Brought down by feelings of regret
Again your mind has failed the test
Not everyone feels the same
Pacifist blinded by the game
Stand tall, they'll break your heart
Stand tall, they'll smash your ego
Stand tall, they'll tear you down
Stand tall, scar your soul
Break your thought, fuck your mind

The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste, losing control
I bleed in pain testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit, pull me from this hole
