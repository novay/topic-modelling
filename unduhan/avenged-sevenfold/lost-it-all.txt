Run away, I'm living with a hole inside
A piece of me that I have yet to find
Edge of reason, lines uneven, turn me off, feel the blood so cold
Like a product that was bought and sold, asking me for the impossible

I ain't waiting for a miracle, I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all

No more faith, no savior made of our designs
Fooled me before, I tell ya' not this time
Raped my body, lost my vision, lost my mind, I had to let it go
Another day living irrational, another day inside this dying soul

I ain't waiting for a miracle, I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all

There's something in your eyes
A part of me that I recognize
I wanna let you know
We'd be there if we could and it's alright
You taught me how to feel
It's no wonder I'd do anything
Tell me why'd you have to go
With the worst to come lost the best I know
Time - seems like we lost it all

Burn it all! Burn it to the fucking ground!
Believe the words that I don't want me around
Life revision, indecision, world collision, and heads will roll
With nothing left except the pain to show
Mental manic driven overflow

I ain't waiting for a miracle, I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all
