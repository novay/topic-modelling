Ride in the shadows wandering beyond the frame
Float like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
"Someone dissolution"
This is "I am all" as "I am none"
Here we fly so high, no, I, no coming down

Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

(I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything)
I walk with death in final exhalation
And come apart through violent separation
A thousand floors ascend into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head)
And down below I leave a stranger laying lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
I ascend and leave behind the "used to be"
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes and see
I see
I see

Nobody

Breathe in the silence, ebb and flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum in light come dark in equal phase
All I ever was, has been and always will be

Here I end as I started again beyond death and borne on the wind
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

A crack in the darkness
A tear in the sky
A narrow moment when we find ourselves
And all we occupy
Return to the boundless
Immerse in the free
Letting go as you lose your name
And all you've known to be

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
