Will you give me my own soul?
Will you let me take control?
I wanna see the things that you see
I wanna be the human you be
I wanna know the secrets inside
I wanna know the feelings you hide
Will you give me my own soul, control?

Tell me how to dream
And tell me what it means
Tell me how to feel
And tell me you believe
Tell me all the things you wanted me to be
Tell me when I'm really alive

Can you feel my love?
Can you feel my love?
