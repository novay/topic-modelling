Godless - meteoric war,
Anger – our existence nevermore.
You awoke the giants who were dormant in the sky,
Comets raining death from a fiery eye.

[Chorus:]
Mother of all, your time is coming,
One with eternity.
When planets collide,
Planets collide.

Damage – galaxy destruct,
Endless - celestial orbit corrupt.
You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

[Chorus]

Take heed, the violent march is closing in,
You can't defeat them on your own.
Weapons are loaded for the final stand,
And they're all aimed at you from heaven!

Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.

You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

[Chorus]
