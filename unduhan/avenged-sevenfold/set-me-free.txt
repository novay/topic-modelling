There's a calmness to the air outside
Watch the sun color the sight of a morning sky
But all I see are clouds of darkest gray
A full eclipse to veil the start of another day

Hear the laughter as the children smile
Hold a newborn close and dream for a little while
But all I hear is death knock at my door
And think of painful journeys our young must endure

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Touch the water with your own two hands
Let the freedom bell bring calm to a troubled land
But all I feel are my two feet in chains
I know the system, but I can't figure out the game

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Take it all away from me
Take it all away...

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
