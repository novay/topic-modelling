This is the story of a man
Who conquered life drink in hand
Ship unmanned
Marked by genius, channelled good
By some a bit misunderstood
They'd been wrong many times before

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints – our saints

Never a stranger to late night snake
Bite fist fights and empty pints
Unrivaled heights
He led with songs, they sang along
Created bonds that held so strong
Some were right and some were wrong

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints – our saints

It's by the sea and at night's end that's when the sin and swill begin
That's when he had that certain light inside his head
For every whisper he would scream for every draught he shared a drink
For every sorrow there is a light from our St. James

On the sea by the cliffs he watches, he waits the night to see
The day – his way
Last call will find us all
But there's a light that leads the way, our way

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints – our saints
