You live your whole life staring at a wall
Your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids
The ones who go out and the ones who are taught to live
One group's taught how and the other group is taught why

There's no need to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see

No reason to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see!

Look what's happening now
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated
Different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?

You live your whole life staring at a wall
Your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?

One group's taught how and the other group is taught why

There's no need to tell you what's in mind

No reason to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see!
