I don't want to know
And I don't want to see you in this place
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face
And I don't want to hear anymore
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor

Get the fuck out of here now
Come on you kids, stand your ground
This is your show, it's your family
All of my friends there for me

There's four-hundred more of us than them
So kick them out
Keep it positive
Keep it real
Keep it true
Together with my friends
I'll be there for you

There's four-hundred more of us than them
So kick them out
Keep it positive
Keep it real
Keep it true
Together with my friends
I'll be there for you

Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through
This is to my brothers, I'll be there for you
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through
This is to my family, I'll be there for you

I don't want to know
And I don't want to see you in this place
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face
And I don't want to hear anymore
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor
