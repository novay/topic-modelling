Black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls
Rain plays a heart warming tune
On the pavement
Emotions stir
A feeling of warmness, compassion
I feel at home
Disguised by surroundings
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance
On their mistreated lives

The torn, left in the cold
Seek vengeance on mistreated lives
The torn, left in the cold
Seek vengeance
Mistreated lives

A silhouette stands still
A darkness on a warm summer night
But the rain falls cold
And the moon shines bright

Black as night
Cold as ice
Warm as home
Ready to live
Stars they shoot
In a clear
Across the sky
As does my time
Waiting, wanting, feeling emotion
Crying, breaking, loving nothing

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Breaking down, breaking away from me
Falling down, breaking away from me
Fuck

I need
This place
To get away from you

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?
