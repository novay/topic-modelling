There you are, you've come so far
Sunny days, the air tastes so sweet, flowers greet
Birds will sing you mean everything
You can be anything

More power
More pace
More money
More taste
More sex
More pills
More skin
More shills
Build tall
Build higher
Build far
Build wider
Build here
Build down
Build up
Build now

Well, look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Unto the mud

More wants
More needs
More hits
Morphine
More speed
More drive
More self
More time
Build out
Build fast
Build strong
Build vast
Build too
Build more
Build all
Build war

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Do unto the mud
Mud

Race to scale the body stack
Lay foot to face atop broken back
A failure here is a failure earned
So do unto the top
Do unto the end
Do unto the mud
Do

More power
More pace
More money
More taste
More sex
More pills
More skin
More shills
More wants
More needs
More hits
Morphine
More speed
More drive
More self
More time
Build tall
Build higher
Build far
Build wider
Build here
Build down
Build up
Build now
Build out
Build fast
Build strong
Build vast
Build, build
Build, build
Build, build
Build, build

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Look at the way that you choose
You know you'll never lose
And all that you are
It was all you deserved anyway
Sunny days

And we love you
And we love you
And we love you
